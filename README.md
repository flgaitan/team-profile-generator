# <team-profile-generator>

## Description
- What was your motivation?
The motivation for this project was to attempt to create what was asked from the prompt and use node with OOP to do so.
- Why did you build this project? 
This project was built to test our understanding of how the back end of a system works. Using node to run the application and trying to debug what went wrong, finding errors within the code .
- What problem does it solve?
This solves the back end portion of understanding the information that can be maniuplated into a server, although this project only touched on that, it was still particularly hard to build and make work.
- What did you learn?
I learned that consoling errors is crucial since we can't tell through breakpoints at what point our code is not executing correctly.
